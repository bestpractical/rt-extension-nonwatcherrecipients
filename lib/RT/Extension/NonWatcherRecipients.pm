=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-NonWatcherRecipients - Note when non-watchers received an
email which RT redistributed to watchers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes email addresses will be added to a thread attached to an RT ticket
because someone wants someone else to know what's going on. However, if that
person isn't added as a Watcher on the RT ticket, they'll likely miss
subsequent correspondence on the thread as RT doesn't know about them.

L<RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients> looks for email addresses on
correspondence that RT doesn't know about and posts a message like this
so you know someone may need to be added:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       From: "A User" <a-user@example.com>

    The following people received a copy of this email but are not on the ticket.
    You may want to add them before replying:
    https://YourRT.com/Ticket/ModifyPeople.html?id=12345

       Cc: "Non Watcher" <non-watcher@example.com>
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want the person to see correspondence, you can click the link and add
them. If not, you can just ignore the message.

You can choose between a text message or html formatted message.

=head1 USAGE

If you run the C<make initdb> step, two new global templates called
C<NonWatcherRecipients Admin Correspondence> and
C<NonWatcherRecipients Admin Correspondence in HTML> are installed on your
system. You can then select one of these templates for any scrips that use the
standard C<Admin Correspondence> or C<Admin Correspondence in HTML> templates.
We recommend the C<Admin Correspondence> templates because you'll need RT
privileges to add the user to the ticket.

You can also add these to existing templates by adding the following
to any template for the plain text version:

    { RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients->FindRecipients(
        Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket ) }

or adding the following for the html version:

    { RT::Extension::NonWatcherRecipients->FindRecipients(
        Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket, Format => 'text/html' ) }

As described below, this method returns a message which is then inserted into
your template.  Look at the installed template for an example.  You may also
call the method and use the returned string however you'd like.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 FindRecipients

Search headers for recipients not included as watchers on the ticket
and return a message to insert in the outgoing email to notify
participants.

Takes:

    (Transaction => $Transaction, Ticket => $Ticket, Format => 'text/html')

Transaction and Ticket are the objects provided in the RT template.
Format is an optional parameter that accepts either 'text/plain' or 'text/html'
and defaults to 'text/plain' if not specified.

Returns: a message to insert in a template
